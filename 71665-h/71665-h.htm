<span class="i0">From the pipes of old Winter, has come a shrill blast,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And upon the gray earth a pure mantle is cast.<br></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis a garment of snow-flakes come down from the skies<br></span>
<span class="i0">And beneath it, in silence, the patient earth lies.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The moaning and rustling of dead leaves is past&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The comforter came, they are sheltered at last.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O, brown leaves of autumn! ’Tis a wise hand that leads,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he sends what is best, who best knoweth our needs.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He gives and he takes, and in taking he gives:<br></span>
<span class="i0">From life cometh death, and in dying we live.<br></span>
<span class="i0">From mists of the river, the brooklet and sea<br></span>
<span class="i0">This beautiful shroud has been woven, and ye<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of its coming wist not, for from out the still air<br></span>
<span class="i0">It as silently fell as an answer to prayer.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O, could ye but creep from your coverlet white<br></span>
<span class="i0">And visit your home, a most wonderful sight<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would gladden your hearts, for the sun met the snow,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the frost followed on with his cold breath, and lo!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your home is a palace of crystal more bright<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than Aladdin beheld with his magical light.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_4">{4}</a></span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Ye glow and ye fade&mdash;but as wondrous to me<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is the leaf on the ground as the leaf on the tree:<br></span>
<span class="i0">For links in time’s chain clasp eternity fast<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the chain becomes endless. Ever the past<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pays its debt to the future, leaf-life, or man’s,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So perfect the system that surely no hands<br></span>
<span class="i0">But of Infinite wisdom and love could be<br></span>
<span class="i0">The author of such an unerring decree.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who knoweth the end? Little leaflets, not we!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enough for ourselves, as we hang on life’s tree,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To gather the sunshine and freely bestow<br></span>
<span class="i0">Our shade to the weary and faint ones below.<br></span>
<span class="i0">And when we grow brown, as, surely we must,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The end will be glorious can we but trust<br></span>
<span class="i0">That the Infinite love, which careth for all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Forgets not the little brown leaves when they fall.<br></span>

<h2><a id="A_SPRING_REVERIE"></a>A SPRING REVERIE</h2>

<p>Winter has at last unlocked the portals of his icy castle and ushered
into our presence the very queen of all the seasons. Let us fling open
the doorways of our hearts and give a generous welcome. How silently she
moves among us, and yet our finer ear may hear her in the springing
grass and opening blossoms. We feel her magic touch in everything about
us. She whispers, and the slumbering earth awakes to new life and
beauty. Would we might sing her praises with hearts as full as the
happy, joyous birds.</p>

<p>I wonder, if we would, we could not make our daily lives fuller of
praises and thanksgiving-songs; clothe wearying, unlovely care, with
beauty? And I wonder, too, if we are not ourselves to blame, if in the
pleasant walks of life we gather not enough of sunshine up to last
through cloudy weather? And yet, we must dream our own dreams and live
our own lives.</p>

<p>The hearts of little children drink in the spring sunshine as freely,
even, as the birds and flowers. And are not their voices sweeter than
the song of birds and their lives dearer than all the blossoms?</p>

<p>A maiden sits and dreams, and in her fancy she weaves the golden meshes
of a nest that will one day be her own, and if her morning and evening
carol shall be sweeter than the bird’s it is not strange, for is not her
nest dearer and her love deeper?</p>

<p>In the spring sunshine a mother muses, and her thoughts have flown
backward. She sits ’mid blasted buds and voiceless birds, in a
springtime of long ago; and though her whole pathway is strewn with
flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span> it is not so much to her as to know that on those little
graves the violets are come again. She tends them with a loving care,
for they speak precious promises unto her soul.</p>

<p>The aged couple number over and over again the many springtimes their
lives have known in light and shadow. They drink not in the full
sunshine of these delicious days, for their nest and nestlings are all
gone, and they are waiting for a more glorious springtime yet to
come&mdash;waiting for eternal sunshine and perpetual blossoms.</p>

<p>Upon the faces of men of great crime, through all the scars of sin, may
be found traces of happy days of innocence and pleasure. Doubtless, as
the springtime sun streams faintly into the cell of many a criminal,
memory is quickened to life by its soft rays, and flowers of tenderness
which have long slumbered bloom again, in the garden of his heart.
Perhaps he may remember days all sunshine, days of loving&mdash;when a dear
face and the light of glad eyes transfigured everything into a world of
glory. But temptation, like sorrow, overtakes us when we are least
prepared, and on the stream of life we either drift with its current, or
with strength of will and determined purpose, pull our fragile bark
against it.</p>

<p>None need so much human sympathy and divine love and favor as the poor
in spirit. The poor in purse may vie in happiness with the rich; but to
a life from which the light of hope has all gone out, the journey to the
end is drear and desolate. Thus, it is we dream our own dreams and live
our own lives, however much we may live for others.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">{17}</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">Her coming&mdash;grateful if she rarely come<br></span>
<span class="i0">And briefly stay.<br></span>

<span class="i8">And so my wish for you<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be my high’st prayer, that peace, God’s peace,<br></span>

<span class="i0">And there abide, your guest, forevermore.<br></span>

<span class="i0">I pinned thee, Rosebud, on his coat<br></span>

<span class="i0">Thy lingering breath is sweet to me<br></span>

<span class="i0">How helpful to my life are forest trees!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their beauty charms me, while their strength sustains<br></span>
<span class="i0">My weakness, and to be a day with them<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is as a sweet communion-day with God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">How, like a strong man, stands the sturdy oak,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mightier than all his fellows; yet he seems<br></span>
<span class="i0">To boast, not strength inherited, so much<br></span>
<span class="i0">As from fierce battling with the elements,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Relying not on Providence alone,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But on himself&mdash;remembering the past,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And how from feebleness he grew to strength.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was ever king in purple and in gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">So grand as they in autumn’s coloring?<br></span>
<span class="i0">A most inspiring lesson to my life<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their beauty teacher. In it, I behold<br></span>

<span class="i0">Of a rich harvest safely garnered in.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Would autumn leaves be just as richly dyed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Did only sunshine and warm summer showers<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fall on them, and the dreary days come not?<br></span>
<span class="i0">But e’en as glory of the king may fade,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or he be robbed of all his rich attire,<br></span>
<span class="i0">So fade and pass away their glories all,<br></span>
<span class="i0">While ever and anon the drear winds sigh<br></span>
<span class="i0">A requiem of sadness. Yet, above<br></span>
<span class="i0">The dead leaves rustling, do the days go on,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And spring-time gladness will return again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O, in their hours of calm, do trees not dream<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of the bright days to come of bud and bloom?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_56">{56}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus do they speak to me, and seem to teach<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous mystery of life and death.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The first spring dandelion’s bloom is more<br></span>
<span class="i0">To me than all the written word; it speaks<br></span>
<span class="i0">Directly to the soul, and seem to be<br></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of God. It is a thing of life,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And what can better solve the mystery?<br></span>
<span class="i0">It is a proof of promises fulfilled,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bids us trust, unfalteringly, when<br></span>
<span class="i0">Again the dead leaves rustle ’neath our feet,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold snow-flakes cover all we love.<br></span>
